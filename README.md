<h1 align="center">Grid-Based Framework üëã</h1>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/d0TfSZ6/framework-project.png" alt="framework-project" border="0">

## About The Project
In this project, we design our own grid-based framework that is similar to Bootstrap, with its own 12-column design and classes for text, button, input, table, navbar styling, etc. We then used the framework to clone the famous design website: Smashing magazine. The sample website is available at [Smashing Magazine Homepage](https://smashingmagazine.com) and the cloned version can be viewed using the live link listed below.
