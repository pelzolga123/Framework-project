# Project: Design Your Own Grid-Based Framework

## Brief introduction

In this project, we design our own grid-based framework that is similar to Bootstrap, with its own 12-column design and classes for text, button, input, table, navbar styling, etc. We then used the framework to clone the famous design website: Smashing magazine.The sample website is available at [Smashing Magazine Homepage](https://smashingmagazine.com) and the cloned version can be viewed using the live link listed below.

## Skills demonstrated after completing the project

CSS Grid System, animation, SASS, box-shadow, positioning
